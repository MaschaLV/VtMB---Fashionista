### Fashionista - Primary Profile

**__The Fashionista Profile is the default profile and the one I would suggest most people use.__**S

A small list of what has been added and changed would include

- The Companion Overhaul - Allows you to hire Companions to fight for you
- The Arsenel Mod - Makes the Guns better but also a bit harder
- Options for the Romance so you can do them with any Gender
- Truly Soaking - so Unarmed Combat is more viable by making Stamina will not add to Leathal Soak

### Default Game Plus Unofficial Patch

For the people that want to experience the game as it originally was presented. The Unofficial Patch is included as the game is unbeatable without it.

Everything else is deselected in this profile

### HD Overhaul

This is a large all-in-one overhaul. It contains HD textures for basically the full game, a new UI, new music, and its own Reshade.

It was included because I wanted to play it.

They only thing you can safely change is the way your Character Looks but they overhauled that as well so I have left all the options to what they intended.
