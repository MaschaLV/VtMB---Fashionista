## Mouse Issues

If you are unable to look around with the mouse, check the options to make sure that Mouse Look is enabled.

Options > Mouse > Mouse Look should be checked, or if it's not on, in game press the `;` key.

## Resolution Issues

The game should have support for most resolutions with the unoffical Patch, but I am unable to test ultrawide displays. Changing the resoltions can be done in the main Menu under  

Options > Resolution.

## Fullscreen or Windowed

To swap between fullscreen and windowed, you can edit the launch options by adding  

`-fullscreen` or `-windowed`

## ENB

The default shortcut to enable or disable the ENB is Shift + F12.
