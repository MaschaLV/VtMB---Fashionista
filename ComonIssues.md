## Mouse Issues

 If you are unable to look around with the mouse check the options to make sure that Mouse Look is enabled

Options > Mouse Tab > Mouse Look should be checked or if its not on in game press the `;` key

## Resolution Issues

 The game should have most resolution support with the unoffical Patch but I am unnable to test ultrawide displays, changing the resoltions can be done in the main Menu under  

Options > Resolution.

## Fullscreen or Windowed

To swap between Full Screen and Windowed you can edit the launch options by adding  

`-fullscreen`
or
`-windowed`
