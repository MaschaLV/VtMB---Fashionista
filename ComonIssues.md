# Common Issues

## Mouse Issues
If you are unable to look around with the mouse check the options to make sure that Mouse Look is enabled

Options > Mouse Tab > Mouse Look should be checked or if its not on in game press the ; key

## Resolution Issues
The game should have most resolution support with the unoffical Patch but I am unnable to test ultrawide displays, changing the resoltions can be done in the main Menu under 

Options > Resolution.

## ENB
The Default Shortcut to enable or disable the ENB is shift + f12
