### Fixes/Changes

1. Changed the default game launch options from Windowed to Fullscreen.
2. Re-did most of the Readme with a better layout, Updated images and additional information.

The Core of this update is updating a bunch of textures that did not have hi-res options switching the main profile to Fullscreen instead of Windowed and some bug fixes and cleanup.

Additional overhaul will need to be looked into later as the exe's are not visable to wabbajack so I can not include them.
